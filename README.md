# Concord
I'm working on an MMORPG called Concord, it also acts as a way to communicate similar to Discord, also it allows you to play board and card games.

## Installation
To install, download the app for your platform from the Releases tab in this GitHub page. Next, run the program once. It should crash with the error code 1, indicating that there is no auth.dat file. You will then need to add a copy of this file sent by the developer to a specific directory. The directory depends on your operating system. Once added, the game should run.
### Windows
%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\Concord
### MacOS
~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/Concord
### Linux
~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Concord

## Troubleshooting
TODO
