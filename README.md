# Concord
I'm working on an MMORPG called Concord, it also acts as a way to communicate similar to Discord, also it allows you to play board and card games.

## Installation
To install, download the app for your platform from the Releases tab in this GitHub page. Next, run the program once to confirm it works, then close it. You will then need to add an authentication file to a specific directory. The directory depends on your operating system.
### Windows
%APPDATA%/Concord
### MacOS and Linux
~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Concord
